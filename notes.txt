Potential refactor?
 How many times is read() called, followed immediately by reading all data and closing the file?
 Might be worth abstracting.

Once I have 0.6.0 ready to go, delete all older versions before releasing it.
0.6.0 needs to at least have that capability for finding multiple versions of a package on a root

packages.list
{
  package_name = "path_to",
}
versions.list
{
  ["0.2.1"] = {
    "0.1.0", "1.0.0", "1.1.9"
  },
  ["0.2.2"] = {
    "1.1.9", "1.2.0"
  }
}
path_to/1.1.9/package.lua -> specific
